Dr. Nirav Pravinbhai Bhatt earned his Bachelor’s degree in Chemical Engineering from The M. S. University of Baroda, a Master’s degree in Chemical Engineering from IIT Madras, and a Doctorate (DSc) from EPFL, Switzerland. He is currently an Assistant Professor at the Wadhwani School of Data Science and AI (WSAI), IIT Madras, and serves as the Program Chair for the MTech in Data Science & AI program at the IIT Madras, Zanzibar campus.

Dr. Bhatt is the head of the BiSECt lab and is affiliated with several research centers at WSAI, including the Robert Bosch Centre for Data Science and AI (RBCDSAI) and the Centre for Integrative Biology and Systems mEdicine (IBSE).

His research interests include the modeling and identification of biological and chemical systems, as well as the application of machine learning and data analysis to engineering and financial systems. In his research, Dr. Bhatt explores biological and disease networks using multi-sensor and multi-scale data. He focuses on the modeling, control, optimization, and integration of (bio-)process manufacturing to enhance efficiency. Additionally, he investigates bioprocess control and process analytical technology for quality assurance. His work also extends to the study of complex man-made networks through data-driven learning and control approaches, with the goal of advancing the understanding and management of these networks.
